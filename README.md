# Default, but Black
*a theme (in the loosest sense of the term) for Obsidian*

As someone who spends way too much time looking at screens in dark conditions, I've gotten excited a few times about themes and plugins that let you make your UI background completely black everywhere. Invariably, though, there's been something about every solution that's gotten on my nerves and I then have to figure out how to turn off.

And I finally broke.

Enter Default But Black!

This is quite literally "Default" with a tiny number of lines modified to provide a true black background everywhere. This will be lightweight, and not conflict with anything whatsoever, because it's straight-up just Default, but black.

Is there a more efficient way to do this? Probably! I literally tableflipped and learned just barely enough about themes to find where Obsidian keeps Default so I could make the Dark Mode I wanted to see in the world! 

(I also noticed that a lot of people are like "how do I find the default CSS?" - so I've made it a little easier. The original values are still there in comments (search for "🌙" to find them), in case you want to do something else with it. Hopefully Obsidian is alright with that.

If I missed anything glaring, please let me know. Pull requests welcome too.

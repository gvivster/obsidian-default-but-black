# Default, but Black
— *a theme (in the loosest sense of the term) for Obsidian* —

As someone who spends way too much time looking at screens in dark conditions, I've gotten excited a few times about themes and plugins that let you make your UI background completely, uncompromisingly black. Everywhere. Invariably, though, there's been something about every solution that's gotten on my nerves and I then have to figure out how to turn off.

Well, I finally broke.

Enter Default But Black!

This is quite literally "Default" with a tiny number of lines modified to provide a true black background everywhere. This will be lightweight, and not conflict with anything whatsoever, because it's straight-up just Default, but black.

Is there a more efficient way to do this? Almost definitely! I straight-up just rage-learned barely enough about themes to find where Obsidian keeps Default so I could make exactly the Dark Mode I wanted to see in the world.

(I also noticed that a lot of people are like "how do I find the default CSS?" *(toggle developer tools > Sources > obsidian.md > app.css)* - so I've made it a little easier. The original values are still there in comments (search for "🌙" to find them), in case you want to do something else with it. Hopefully Obsidian is alright with that.

If I missed anything glaring, please let me know. Pull requests welcome too.
